Python Teletext Service
-----------------------

This software generates the packet stream for a full teletext
service with up to 8 magazines, 0xff pages per magazine, and
3f7f subpages per page.

Usage
-----

The packets will be written to stdout, so you must pipe it
in to some teletext handling software such as raspi-teletext:

./main.py <data> | ../raspi-teletext/teletext

The data directory holds all pages and subpages you want to
transmit. The data must be split into directories:

./<page>/<subpage>.tt

See examples folder.

The data directory is monitored constantly for changes so
you can generate or edit pages in any external program. As
soon as they are saved they will be added to the rotation.

TODO
----

Use python generators instead of loops.
