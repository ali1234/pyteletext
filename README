Python Teletext Service
-----------------------

This software generates the packet stream for a full teletext
service with up to 8 magazines, 0xff pages per magazine, and
3f7f subpages per page.

Usage
-----

The packets will be written to stdout, so you must pipe it
in to some teletext handling software such as raspi-teletext:

./main.py <data> | ../raspi-teletext/teletext

The data directory holds all pages and subpages you want to
transmit. The data must be split into directories:

./<page>/<subpage>.tt

See examples folder.

TODO
----

Use python generators instead of loops.
